# Hinge Loss in Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of hinge loss in machine learning, implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Hinge loss is primarily used for training classifiers, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This notebook demonstrates the calculation and application of hinge loss in various scenarios.

## Project Overview

The notebook `hinge loss.ipynb` covers the following:

1. **Introduction to Hinge Loss**: Explanation of hinge loss and its importance in machine learning.
2. **Mathematical Formulation**: Detailed mathematical formulation of hinge loss.
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation of hinge loss using Python.
4. **Application**: Application of hinge loss in training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model performance using hinge loss and other metrics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdullah7/hinge-loss.git
    cd hinge-loss
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook hinge loss.ipynb
```

### Notebook Sections

- **Loading the Dataset**: Importing a sample dataset for demonstration.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
- **Hinge Loss Implementation**: Implementing the hinge loss function from scratch.
- **Training the Model**: Using the hinge loss to train an SVM classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the classifier's performance using hinge loss and comparing it with other metrics.

## Results

The notebook demonstrates how hinge loss is used to train an SVM classifier. It also compares the performance of the classifier using hinge loss with other performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Key Metrics

- **Hinge Loss**: Loss function used for training the SVM classifier.
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the classifier.
- **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability of the classifier to identify positive instances.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
