# Hinge Loss in Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of hinge loss in machine learning, implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Hinge loss is primarily used for training classifiers, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This notebook demonstrates the calculation and application of hinge loss in various scenarios.

## Project Overview

The notebook `hinge loss.ipynb` covers the following:

1. **Introduction to Hinge Loss**: Explanation of hinge loss and its importance in machine learning.
2. **Mathematical Formulation**: Detailed mathematical formulation of hinge loss.
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation of hinge loss using Python.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model performance using hinge loss and other metrics.

### Introduction to Hinge Loss

Hinge loss is a loss function used primarily for training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and other classification algorithms. It is designed to ensure that the predictions not only make the correct classification but also are confident in those predictions. The hinge loss for an individual prediction is given by:

\[ L(y, f(x)) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot f(x)) \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the true class label (+1 or -1),
- \( f(x) \) is the predicted value.

If the prediction is correct and confident, the loss is zero. If the prediction is incorrect or not confident enough, the loss increases linearly.

### Mathematical Formulation

The hinge loss can be formulated as follows:

\[ L(y, f(x)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max(0, 1 - y_i \cdot f(x_i)) \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of training examples,
- \( y_i \) is the true label for the i-th example,
- \( f(x_i) \) is the predicted value for the i-th example.

The objective is to minimize this loss function, which leads to finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with maximum margin.

### Implementation

The implementation section provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the hinge loss function in Python. This includes:

- Defining the hinge loss function.
- Implementing gradient descent for optimizing the loss.
- Training an SVM classifier using the implemented hinge loss function.


### Evaluation

The evaluation section measures the performance of the SVM classifier using hinge loss and compares it with other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in understanding the effectiveness of hinge loss in training robust classifiers.
